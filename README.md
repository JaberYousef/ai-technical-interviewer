# AI Interview Coach 🎤💻

An AI-powered web app that helps you prepare for technical interviews by simulating the experience of talking to a recruiter while solving coding problems.

---

## 📌 Overview
AI Interview Coach creates a realistic mock interview environment for coding practice.  
While you work on LeetCode (or similar platforms), the AI recruiter can observe your coding session, ask follow-up questions, and provide real-time feedback.  

The goal is to make interview prep more engaging, less intimidating, and closer to the real experience.

## ✨ Features (Planned)
- 🎙️ **Conversational AI** – Talk to the AI as if it were a recruiter.  
- 👀 **Code Awareness** – The AI can see your code and comment on your approach.  
- ❓ **Interview Simulation** – Ask follow-up questions about time/space complexity, edge cases, and test coverage.  
- 📝 **Feedback** – Get actionable insights on your problem-solving and communication skills.

## 🚀 Vision
Preparing for interviews can be stressful and lonely.  
AI Interview Coach acts as a personal mock interviewer who is always available — making practice sessions interactive, supportive, and closer to a real interview environment.

## 📅 Current Status
This project is in the early development stage.  
I’m starting with a simple MVP that allows screen sharing, conversation with an AI, and basic feedback loops.
